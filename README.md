# BP-neural-network-iris-dataset
Environment: Python 3.8

Library: numpy, sklearn, matplotlib

The main content of this assignment is to build a neural network with a single hidden layer. During this assignment, we can learn how to:

Use python to write code

Use numpy and sklearn to download dataset and compute

Use MLP algorithm and Gradient Descend to build a neural network

Use cross-validation to test the accuracy of neural network

Use functions to fulfill the request, such as ‘shuffle’, ‘np.random.uniform’, ‘np.outer’, etc.
